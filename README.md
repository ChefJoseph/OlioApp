# Olio, the olive oil specialty store

## Overview

Olio is fullstack e-commerce site. As a chef with a passion in Italian cuisine, olive oil is the foundation of every dish. 
Following Cucina regionale principles, every authentic dish should utitlize ingredients made in each specific region. 
Thus I developed a site dedicated to the the variety of olive oil found every climate of Italy and beyond.
